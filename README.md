PowerTimer: A Workout timer with a built-in Rest Timer
---

**This app is no longer on the App store and will not be updated or supported any longer.**

PowerTimer is a standard workout timer, which also includes a second, rest timer.

If you're a powerlifter, you typically need to time your rests between sets.
I always use a timer app on my phone, but have difficulty remembering when my last set
ended and when my next set should begin.

This app has a second timer that is used as a rest timer.

* Once you finish your set, simply tap the rest timer and let it start counting.
* When your rest is over, tap the rest timer again to clear it.

The timer will turn RED when your rest is up. You can configure the rest time via settings.

The best part is, **you can continue to keep the time of your entire workout!**
